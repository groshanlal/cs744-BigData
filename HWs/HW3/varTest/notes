It is interesting that although the updates are happening asynchronously the variable server of TF internally handles all of the updates to the shared variables.

However I do not see any differences between the local and global one


When I changed the globalVar from task 0 to 2, the output is not consistent anymore for 20 concurrent sessions and the race condition kicks in. the final output for 21 updates is 1998,2000
for 3 consurrent sessions, we have 300,297. the local one is also having problem.

the only point is the variables are kept for multiple session runs


it seems the default behaviour of assign_add is without locking. this locking mechnism can be set to true as a parameter to the assign add
