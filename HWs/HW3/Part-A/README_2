In order to implement the big matmul problem we used two main ideas to first make all computations local and then minimaize the communicated data to increase both CPU and network utilizations. 
To have data locality we used a pairing hash function to map the blocks that need to be multiplied to one of the nodes in cluster. this hashing function surves two purposes: first it guarnatees the related blocks from the large matrix are in same place that reduces computation time utilizing data locality. second it minimizes the communication related to calculating multiplication and diag as we only need to communicate the aggregated float data type instead of whole blocks of matrix
